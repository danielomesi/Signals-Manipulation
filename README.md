As part of the course "Introduction to Digital Signal Processing", I have implemented several python programs which manipulate finite discrete signals.

Options in the program:

Divide a signal to a sum of an odd and even signals

Original Signal:
![Signal](./Images/Signal.jpg)

Odd Signal:
![Odd Signal](./Images/Odd_Signal.jpg)

Even Signal:
![Odd Signal](./Images/Even_Signal.jpg)

Calculate the fourier coefficints of a signal and display the N-th first coefficints and see how with the growth of N, the graph is more similar to the actual signal.

N=4
![Odd Signal](./Images/N=4.jpg)

N=7
![Odd Signal](./Images/N=7.jpg)

N=12
![Odd Signal](./Images/N=12.jpg)

Other options:
-Flip a signal
-Multiply a signal by a scalar
-Sum signals
